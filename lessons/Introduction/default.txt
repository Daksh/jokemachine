Joke Machine: Lesson Plans Overview

Joke Machine allows students to create their own multimedia jokebook – a project that helps with reading, writing and cultural learning. Each joke can include an image and a sound effect. These can be created with another XO activity, such as Paint, Record or Flipsticks. Jokebooks can be saved to the Journal and shared with friends using the Mesh network. A student can also use the Mesh to submit a joke to a friend's jokebook. The author of the jokebook gets to decide whether to accept a new joke or not.

Joke Machine can be integrated into many school subject areas such as creative writing, art, and social studies.  Students learn how to articulate and share creative ideas. They are also given tools that allow them to review submissions and make editorial choices.
