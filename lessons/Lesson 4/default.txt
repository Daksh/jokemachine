Lesson 4: Reviewing and Editing Jokebook Submissions
You are the editor of your jokebook and that means you decide what goes into it. When someone sends you a joke submission, you can read it and decide if you want to add it to your jokebook or not. 

Your XO will be updated with joke submissions while you are sharing it over the mesh. An alert message will let you know if a joke suggestion is ready for you to review.

Click the "Review Submitted Jokes" tab on your Joke Machine interface and you will see any jokes that have been sent to you.

If you like a joke, "Click the "Approved" button
I f you don't like a joke, click the "Rejected" button
If you are not sure, leave the approval setting as "Unreviewed"

After you approve a joke, it is added to your jokebook. New jokes can be seen by other users the next time you share that jokebook. 

After reading and editing your jokebooks, talk about the experience together as a class:

Talk about what makes a good joke.You may want to make a list on paper or using WRITE on the XO.  Some concepts to discuss: Surprise, Rhythm, Shortness, Action
Look at each other’s pictures and discuss how the image relates to the words of a joke. How do images add humor? Does an image ever make the joke less funny
Talk about the sound effects in your jokebooks. How do sounds add humor? Does a sound ever make the joke less funny?
