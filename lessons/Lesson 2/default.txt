Lesson 2: Create a Jokebook with Joke Machine
After collecting a set of jokes, and creating images and sounds to go with them, you can create an original jokebook with the Joke Machine.

From the Home screen of your XO,click on the Joke Machine icon to open the activity. You can also open it from theMaMaMedia Creative Center.

Click the "Make jokebooks" button at the bottom of the screen to start a new jokebook. You will see three tabs at the top of the Jokebook editing screen:
Edit Jokebook Cover
Edit My Jokes
Review Submitted Jokes

At first you will be on the "Edit Jokebook Cover" tab:
Type in your jokebook title (i.e. "Celia's Favorite Jokes")
Click on the camera button to find a picture or photo from your Journal that you wish to use as the cover image. 
You can also find a sound effect in your journal and add it to the cover.

When you are happy with the cover, click on "Edit My Jokes" to add your jokes:
Type in the Question and Answer for your jokes in the text fields.
Click on the camera button to find a picture or photo from your Journal that you wish to use as the image with a joke. (Joke Machine will automatically make your picture the right size to fit in your jokebook.)
There is a delete button in case you decide you want to delete the joke later.
Click "Add Joke" to start creating another joke for your jokebook.
After you add your jokes, click "Preview" to see how your jokebook looks!

When you are happy with your jokebook, click on the Journal icon (open book at the top of your screen) to keep a copy of it in your Journal.

Present your jokebook to your class. Select the "Share with: My Neighborhood" option  in the top bar of your screen. This will allow other XO users in your 'neighborhood' to see your jokebook and read it through the Mesh network.
