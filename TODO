** Remove the crapload of UI functions if sharee  DONE

= To Do =

* Mesh
** Make mesh work!


* Check in code & Trac component WAITING
** My domains are either gone or down - wait a few hours, if not back up then
   do the big txfer else do the big txfer THIS WEEK !! :-(


* GUI 
** Not going back to read jokebooks from edit mode on build 613 ?
** Preview mode shows make jokebook button - shouldn't
** Prepend Cover on preview
** Submit a Joke button -> only for foreigners
** On read jokebook & empty -> "Edit My Jokes" -> Go to edit my jokes tab
** Jokebook Info -> Edit Jokebook Cover  DONE
** Refactor Page.make_* infrastructure
*** Factor out CanvasText's and replace with a better make_text
*** Add a make_button as well
*** Refactor Page.make_imagebox & ObjectChooser code - it's squishy!
** Fix gtkrc for non-default frame states


* Multimedia - Images/Audio
** Filter ObjectChooser to only list images/audio -> https://dev.laptop.org/ticket/3060
** Select a sound to play on Joke punchlines  DONE
*** NOTE writing out sound_blob to temp file for now before handing to gstreamer
** fold image/image_blob into a single property?
** fold sound/sound_blob into a single property?


* Persistence
** Build# 613 - keep/save problems ?
** Some sample jokes
** Restore last known state of activity instead of starting from scratch when not started from Journal - YES
*** Chat to eben
** Create and set activity_version property for persistence.JokeMachineState.version
** Don't persist if there are no jokebooks
** Can we point to datastore objects rather than having to copy them into our
   own datastructures - has disadvantage that deleting an object from the
   datastore that's in use will delete it from the joke - also creates problems
   when sharing...


* Memory
** If memory should become a problem... write pickle restored from journal out 
   to disk and extend Persistence interface to feed from disk rather than RAM


* i18n
** Do a test translation into Afrikaans
** Make language selection button work
** Double check that all strings are gettexted


* Lesson Plans
** Make Lesson Plans button work


* Unit Tests
** Split unit.py out into separate test cases 



= Known Problems =

* Sugar Versions
** Vanishing controls on Build 542.3 running on B2 hardware - bring up & hide developer terminal to reset
** gtk.TextViews have borders on Build 557 which shouldn't be there
** These problems are all fixed on Build >600 and sugar-jhbuild

* Audio
** Audio b0rk3d on B2 Hardware w/ build 542.3

* Edit Jokebook -> Review Jokes
** Present&working, but no way to submit jokes to it as mesh code is still coming up :-)
** If you want to see some sample data with waiting submissions edit persistence/jokemachinestate.py -> test_data() -> num_jokebooks = a number bigger than zero

* Bugs
** Activity Icon not being set to theme colors
** Language selection button not theming as it should DONE
*** We can also lose theme_widget seeing as we're using a custom gtkrc now
