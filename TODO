= To Do =

* Figure out why only alerts are being translated
* Double check that all strings are gettexted
* Use hippo.PACK_EXPAND to get rid of hardcoded sizes
* Get a fix on memory useage
* Create and set activity_version property for persistence.JokeMachineState.version
* Split unit.py out into separate test cases 
* Refactor Page.make_* infrastructure

* Things waiting for the journal to settle
** Filter ObjectChooser to only list images/audio -> https://dev.laptop.org/ticket/3060
** Create sample Jokebooks in the journal on bundle installation
** Fold image/image_blob into a single property
** Fold sound/sound_blob into a single property
** Bring up the last Jokebooks instead of starting from scratch when started from the frame
** Don't persist if there are no jokebooks 


= Known Problems =

* i18n is only translating alerts at the moment for some strange reason
* AudioPlayer dumps files into /tmp which may be problematic for security system
* Deprecating theme_widget() for custom gtkrc fixes language combo but there are now faint hints of Irish in the activity frame :)
